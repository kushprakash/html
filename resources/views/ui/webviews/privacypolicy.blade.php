offer certain features that are only available through the use of a “cookie”. We also use cookies
to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us
provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are “session cookies,”
meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You
are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may
not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your
password more frequently during a session.<br>
Additionally, you may encounter “cookies” or other similar devices on certain pages of the
Website that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

collect such information into a file specific to you.<br>

Website without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do
